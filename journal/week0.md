### Installing AWS CLS

I install AWS CLS using Gitpod vs workspace. I initially encounter issue when I want to push the changes
But I figure it out by granting access to Gitpod to make psuh changes to Github from the control environment of Gitpod

I went through the follow along to achieve the installation.

The codes I used for the installing

```

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

```
