# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Home Work Tasks

### Installing AWS CLS

I install AWS CLS using Gitpod vs workspace. I initially encounter issue when I want to push the changes
But I figure it out by granting access to Gitpod to make psuh changes to Github from the control environment of Gitpod

I went through the follow along to achieve the installation.

The codes I used for the installing

```

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

```

# Home work challenge

### Installing a Billing alarm 

I installed a billing alarm using the console. I did not use the commandline because the credential I setup on the CLI does
not have access to billing and will not be able to create alarm. 
But I pin the CLI code in my repo and I am sure it will work and also inother to protect my privacy.

## Logical Diagram creation

I created the conceptual diagram and the logical diagram of the Cruddur app using Lucid chart
But unfortunately, I ran out of free access for the shapes . It is now requesting for payment to continue adding shape.
Because of this, I could not complete the logical diagram.
